# How to Write Documentation

You can help improve the PredictionIO documentation by submitting tutorials,
how-tos, fixing error, or adding missing information.

You can either open a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the
`livedoc` branch for instant update or the `develop` branch for the next
release.

If you are unsure of the documentation changes, please file an issue.
