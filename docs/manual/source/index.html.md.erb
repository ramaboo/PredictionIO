# Welcome to PredictionIO <%= data.versions.pio %>

PredictionIO is an open source Machine Learning Server. It empowers developers
and data scientists to build smart applications with data productively.

PredictionIO currently offers two engine templates for Apache Spark MLlib:

* Collaborative Filtering Engine Template - with MLlib ALS
* Classification Engine Template - with MLlib Naive Bayes

With these templates, you can create a custom predictive engine for production deployment efficiently:

* predict user behaviors and demand
* offer personalized video, news, deals, ads and job openings
* help users to discover interesting events, documents, apps and restaurants
* spam detection
* and more...

A standard PredictionIO stack is built on top of solid open source technology,
such as Scala, Apache Spark, HBase and Elasticsearch.
